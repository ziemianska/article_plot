As in aforementioned publication:

Figure 7 shows comparison of reinforcement learning model fits based on ΔAIC values.
 Panels correspond to: 
 (a) alcohol, 
 (b) saccharin, 
 (c) alcohol + saccharin, 
 and (d) water. 
 Each point represents an individual mouse, the boxplots show medians, 1st and 3rd quartiles. 
 Each box plot in the alcohol and saccharin groups corresponds to 28 animals, alcohol + saccharin — 13, and water — 14.
 
 AIC value ( Akaike's information criterion) was used to assess the goodness of fit.
 Overall, the models approximated the observed behavior better than a purely random choice approach for all rewards except the water control. 
 Moreover, there were larger differences in the goodness of fit for rewards that produced stronger preference (i.e., saccharin and alcohol + saccharin). 
 The best scoring models, “hybrid” and “Qd + hybrid,” shared two features: separate learning rates for positive and negative outcomes and a fictitious update of the expected value of the nonselected alternative.
